Description:
This project is the result of my diploma work provided on the such topic as "Creating desktop version of USOS type system for educational facilities".
During this research I tried to create example , from my point of view , of such system.
At first this system consist of two parts : clients and database .
Clients i realised using Java language , because I think that java one of the most suitable programing language for creating programm connected with establishing design by using panel's classes.
I used word "clients" instead of client because on the first step of creating this project I found the necessary of administrating data and organizing all types interactions with user accounts.
User accounts i divided into two group : students and teachers. Each group have it's unique features , possibilities and also limitations . All these two groups are complitely under the control of admins.
Also , admins divided into three groups according to their rights and hierarchies inside these facilities : high admins , high admins with limitations  and admins. Inside my work i described that such separations are need for supporting level of security of data , organizing of work .
Then next part of this system is database.
For this I choose MySQL language. This is simple for understanding langing for creating database , which don't create any dificulties for learning and using it.
This is simple description of my project , if you want to receive more information about it , please write to me.

Group of users:
-students(or could be any another group of people who study inside educational institutions )
-teachers
-admins(program has three different levels of graduation of admins rights)
